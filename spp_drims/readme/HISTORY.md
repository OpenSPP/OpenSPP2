### 19.0.3.0.1

- fix(drims): a dispatch validated short no longer leaves the request looking fully dispatched. The backorder is announced on the request with a to-do for the coordinators, the request reopens as Ready for Dispatch so the remaining balance can be dispatched again, and the dispatched totals are rebuilt on the allocation rows. Applies however the transfer is validated — the web client, the barcode flow or the API (#1087)

### 19.0.3.0.0

- feat(drims): allocate stock per source warehouse. The Allocate Stock wizard now auto-splits each requested line across the DRIMS warehouses that hold stock (e.g. 70 → 50 @ WH1 + 20 @ WH2) with editable rows; the split is captured on a new per-warehouse allocation record, shown on the request's Allocations tab and summarised in a "Source Warehouse(s)" column on the Requests list; dispatch creates one picking per source warehouse. The single "Source Warehouse" field on the request has been removed — the warehouse(s) are chosen in the wizard. The allocation wizard distinguishes no-stock, stock-shortfall and deliberate partial-allocation cases with clear messages, and the request line's Fulfillment % tracks allocated ÷ requested so the bar reflects allocation progress (#1079)
- feat(drims): Requests review UI/UX overhaul — post-approval fulfillment lanes, allocation shortfall indicators, and a destination-type selector (#1075)

### 19.0.2.0.0

- Initial migration to OpenSPP2
